# web-experiment
An alternative match viewer for Tiltyard, in the form of a single-page app.

Built with TypeScript and React.

TODOs:
- Less ugly list of matches
  - Visual indicator of completion/abandonment
- Limit visual length of moves list
- Scroll matches list independently of rest of viewer
- Adjust match visualization to available screen space (?)
- Get updates to match list live
- Filter down matches by player(s), game(s), or tournament
  - UI for choosing these
  - When filtered by player, follow new matches as they start
- Ability to load more matches
- Deconflict global and local loads of game metadata
